The **Agent Framework Dev Project** is a community initiative providing materials for instructor-led, hands-on, developer-focused training for building AI agents using modern frameworks and tooling.

Our current lab and presentation materials focus on instructor-led lab material for **Agent Framework Dev Days** with labs, decks, and supporting assets.

Some of our current choices: 

* Using **Microsoft Agent Framework** (open source, released Oct 2025) for building AI Agents
* Using **Microsoft Foundry** platform for running AI Agents with observability, safety, and other enterprise-grade features
* Applying practical agent architectures, tools, and workflows, including human-in-the-loop
* Applying useful real-world patterns for building, evaluating, and operating AI agents

## Audience

Our primary audience is **developers** (and aspiring developers) building, learning to build, or just exploring. 

We strive to help you get started developing Agent-based AI systems that: 

* Use tools
* Use workflows
* Apply RAG and agentic RAG patterns
* Are observable
* Engage AI safety mechanisms
