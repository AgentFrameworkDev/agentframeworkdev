# Instructions for GitHub Copilot

This repo hosts a GitHub Pages (Jekyll) source files for a website. When making changes to this repo, usually they are intended for the website generated from this repo, not the repo README.md. The repo README.md is only a brief summary of the project.

Small changes to the website should be deployed immediately after making the change. Larger changes may require review and testing or a PR before deployment.

The hosted website can be found at [Agent Framework Project](https://agentframework.dev).

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT edit README.md unless the user explicitly asks to change README.
- For content changes, identify the target website file first (usually index.html or a page/post),
  then apply minimal edits only to that file.
- If uncertain where content lives, search for the text in website files before editing anything.
